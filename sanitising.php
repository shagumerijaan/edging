                     <h2>Sanitising Services</h2>
                     <p>Do you have a plan in place to protect your staff, customers and building occupants from the spread of illness? The grave threat of viruses like Coronavirus, Influenza A, MRSA and Norovirus requires that we take aggressive steps to lesson the risk of contamination. A rigorous disinfection, sanitization and cleaning can do just that. <br /><br />

Our cleaning product kills 99% of viruses and bacteria, including Human Coronavirus, Influenza, Norwalk Virus, SARS, Herpes Complex and HIV-1. The disinfectant will thoroughly sanitize the space, however with the reintroduction of people, the building can become contaminated again. Therefore, it’s important to note, that our services only reduce the risk of virus contamination, they don’t prevent it.</p>
					<h4>Our Sanitization Process</h4>
					<p>1. First the space must be properly prepared for the disinfectant spray. This means that any ingestible items or items that may be placed in your mouth like toothbrushes, toys and utensils must be stored away. Pets and their food bowls, toys, and beds must be removed as well. All occupants should leave the building while the space is being treated.<br /><br />

2. Next we will use professional grade equipment and cleaning products to disinfect and sanitize the space. Our industrial cleaner will kill 99% of germs.<br /><br />

3. After 30 minutes, the space can be inhabited again. We will then professionally clean the space to remove any left over solution ensuring a safe home or building.</p>
