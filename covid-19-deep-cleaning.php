                     <h2>Deep Cleaning Services</h2>
                     <p>Deep cleaning is quite laborious and time consuming process. We recommend a deep cleaning if you have not had your apartment professionally cleaned within the past 3-5 months, or if you do not use a cleaning service on a regular basis. A deep clean includes all the services of a standard clean but with more attention to details. <br /><br />
If your home hasn’t been cleaned for a long time and there are greasy surfaces, or dirt and dust buildup then you may need Heavy Condition Cleaning or Filthy Cleaning. Please send photos if you would like to be sure you qualify for a deep cleaning. If we show up and see that you are not qualified for a deep clean then we may not be able to complete the cleaning or the rates will be converted to heavy/filthy cleaning rates.<br /><br />
Every home is unique, the duration you see on a booking page when booking an appointment is averaged. We don’t provide flat rates for deep cleaning, we base on the size of the apartment/house, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, floors, and the most important thing - condition. We approach to each home individually and do our best to meet your expectations.</p>
